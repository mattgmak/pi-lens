 * fail-open-on-corrupt read), but keyed PER FILE with its own scan timestamp
 * rather than one global `scannedAt` — a workspace sweep can span many
 * seconds/minutes across thousands of files, each finishing at a different
 * time, so a single project-wide timestamp would either understate or
 * overstate every individual file's real staleness window.
 *
 * NEVER persist an inconclusive/timed-out `touchFile` result here — an
 * unconfirmed result read back as "cached clean" on a later sweep is exactly
 * the false-clean bug class #571/#630 already fixed for the live path; a
