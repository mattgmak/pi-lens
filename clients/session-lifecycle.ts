/**
 * Concurrent-session guard (#473).
 *
 * In-process subagent extensions (tintinweb/pi-subagents-style: a fresh
 * `AgentSession` built and `bindExtensions()`-ed inside the SAME Node process
 * as the parent pi session) reuse pi's process-global extension-loader cache,
 * so the subagent's `session_start` re-invokes pi-lens's SAME module-scope
 * singletons the parent is still using. Left unguarded, `handleSessionStart`
 * destructively resets shared state (`resetLSPService({fast:true})` kills
 * every live LSP client; `runtime.resetForSession()` bumps the session
 * generation, silently orphaning the parent's in-flight continuations gated
 * on `isCurrentSession`) while the parent is mid-turn.
 *
 * pi's own SDK contract only invalidates a captured ctx for SEQUENTIAL
 * session replacement (`newSession`/`fork`/`switchSession`/`reload` —
 * `ExtensionRunner.invalidate()`, called from `core/agent-session.js` on
 * dispose). A concurrently-live sibling session's bind invalidates nothing.
 * That asymmetry — is the PRIOR ctx still active or not — is the reliable,
 * empirically-verified discriminator this module implements.
 *
 * Fail-safe direction is non-negotiable: whenever classification is
 * uncertain, this module falls back to today's behavior (treat as a
 * sequential replacement, i.e. run the full reset). It only suppresses the
 * reset on POSITIVE evidence that a live sibling primary session exists.
 *
 * Kill switch: `PI_LENS_CONCURRENT_SESSION_GUARD=0` disables the guard
 * entirely — every session_start classifies as if sequential (today's
 * behavior), matching the lazy-env-read house style (see
 * `subagent-mode.ts` / `runtime-config.ts`).
