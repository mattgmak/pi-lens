/**
 * Regression matrix for #1098: `resolveExec` used to drop
 * `config.args(testFile, cwd)[0]` UNCONDITIONALLY whenever local-bin or
 * global-bin resolution succeeded — an npx-wrapper-convention assumption
 * (arg 0 names the binary, like `npx vitest run …`) that only holds for
 * wrapper-style runners (vitest/jest/pytest). For direct runners whose
 * args() leads with a REAL subcommand (`cargo test --no-fail-fast`,
 * `go test -run . ./pkg`, `dotnet test --no-build`, `mvn test -q`,
 * `mix test <file>`), the same unconditional `.slice(1)` silently ate the
 * subcommand — e.g. `cargo test --no-fail-fast` became the argv-invalid
 * `cargo --no-fail-fast` (a clap usage error), which the runner then
 * misreported as "1/1 failed" at turn-end.
 *
 * The fix (`stripWrapperArgs` in clients/test-runner-client.ts) only drops
 * the leading arg(s) when they actually NAME the resolved binary — either
 * `[binName, ...]` (vitest/jest) or `["-m", binName, ...]` (pytest) — and
 * leaves everything else untouched.
 *
 * This asserts the invariant generically by iterating the EXPORTED
 * `RUNNERS` config table (not a hand-copied runner list), across every
 * resolution path `resolveExec` can take:
 *   - local-bin hit  (a real file dropped in node_modules/.bin, or
 *                      vendor/bin for phpunit's Composer convention)
 *   - global-bin hit (findGlobalBinary mocked to resolve)
 *   - fallback       (neither resolves; config.command is used verbatim)
 * so a future runner added to RUNNERS is automatically covered.
 *
 * The expected argv for each case is computed independently of the
 * production `stripWrapperArgs` helper (a local re-statement of the same
 * contract), so a regression that reintroduces unconditional stripping (or
 * any other over/under-stripping) fails this test rather than trivially
 * agreeing with whatever the implementation currently does.
